# INSTALL
1. Clone this project into your local device or download the zip file.
2. Open the project in your code editor (ex. VSC, Atom.)
3. Open two terminal windows in the project.
4. In the first terminal, navigate to the server folder (cd /server). In the second terminal, navigate to the client folder (cd /client).
5. In both terminals, install all the necessary dependencies (npm install).
6. In the server folder, create a new file. Call it ".env". To connect the app to the database, add this line to the ".env" file: "MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://adminAccess:teddiesRunFast@clustermain.ao2jff7.mongodb.net/tracking?retryWrites=true".
Ready to run!
7. Save all the files and start with the server, run "npm start", then run the same command in the client terminal. BOOM!

# ISSUES
Upon the initial loading of the website, the splash screen functions as intended. However, upon subsequent attempts, the logo fails to appear or experiences a delay in loading.
